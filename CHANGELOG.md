## OLD protected_attributes CHANGELOG
## 1.1.4

* Avoid double callbacks in Rails >= 4.1.

* Fixes UnitializedConstant in TooManyRecords.

## 1.1.3

* Fix deprecation code.

## 1.1.2

* Deprecate `config.active_record.whitelist_attributes`.

* Fix integration with associations.

## 1.1.1

* Fix strong parameters integration.

* Remove warnings

* Fix `find_or_*` and `first_or_*` methods integration.

## 1.1.0

* Integrate with strong parameters. This allows to migrate a codebase partially
  from `protected_attributes` to `strong_parameters`. Every model that does not
  use a protection macro (`attr_accessible` or `attr_protected`), will be
  protected by strong parameters. The behavior stays the same for models, which
  use a protection macro.

  To fully restore the old behavior set:

      config.action_controller.permit_all_parameters = true

  Or add a callback to your controllers like this:

      before_action { params.permit! }

  Fixes #41.
